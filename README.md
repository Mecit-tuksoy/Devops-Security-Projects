# "Creating and Securing Netflix Clone on GCP Using DevOps Tools (SonarQube, OWASP, Trivy, Jenkins, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana)"

## This project aims to create a clone of the popular streaming platform Netflix and securely deploy it using modern DevOps practices. 

The project includes:

A Netflix-like user interface developed using React and TypeScript.

Using real movie and TV show data with TMDB API integration.

Setting up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with Jenkins.

Conducting code quality and security analysis with SonarQube.

Conducting security scans with OWASP and Trivy tools.

Containerizing the application using Docker.

Deploying the application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Monitoring application performance and infrastructure with Prometheus and Grafana.

This project aims to create a secure, scalable, and high-performance streaming platform clone by combining modern web development techniques, DevOps practices, and cloud technologies. At the same time, it provides a continuous improvement and security-focused development process using industry-standard tools.
